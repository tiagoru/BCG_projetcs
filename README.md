## Feature Engineering and Modelling for Churn (BCG Data Science Completion Certificate)

This repository contains the code and analysis completed for the BCG Data Science Completion Certificate exercise on Feature Engineering and Modelling for Churn. 

**Exercise Completed:** November 22, 2024

### Project Description

This project simulates customer churn analysis for XYZ Analytics. The goal is to demonstrate advanced data analytics skills by:

* Identifying essential client data
* Outlining a strategic investigation approach
* Building a model to predict customer churn

The project involves:

1. Importing necessary packages
2. Loading and preparing customer data
3. Feature engineering and data exploration
4. Model building and optimization (random forest)

**Achievement:**  > Achieved an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn using a random forest model.
